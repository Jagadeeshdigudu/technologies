    <img src="/django.logo.png" alt="image not found">
    <p>Django was created in the autumn of 2003, when the web programmers at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper, Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison, began using Python to build applications. Jacob Kaplan-Moss was hired early in Django's development shortly before Willison's internship ended.[15] It was released publicly under a BSD license in July 2005. The framework was named after guitarist Django Reinhardt.[16] Holovaty is a romani jazz guitar player inspired in part by Reinhardt's music.[17]</p>
